# One-Click-Partition-Creator-and-Storage-Manager
Is the offline-first application that enables users to create and manage storage partitions through a centralized Oracle database hosted on a local server. Users perform all operations via the client app, while only the admin can trigger secure, one-click backups to the cloud (e.g., Google Drive) when internet connectivity is available.
